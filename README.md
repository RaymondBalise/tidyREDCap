# tidyREDCap <a href='https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/'><img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" width="139" /></a>

tidyREDCap is an R package with functions for processing REDCap data. 

'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data CAPture; <https://projectredcap.org>) is a web-enabled application for building and managing surveys and databases developed at Vanderbilt University.

## What tidyREDCap Functions Can Do for You?

#### Load All Data from REDCap into R with One Line of Code

* ðŸ’¥ NEW in Version 1.1 ðŸ’¥ `import_instruments()` includes the repeat number for repeated instruments/forms/questionnaires.

* `import_instruments()` will use an API call to load every instrument/questionnaire into its own R dataset.  If the REDCap project is longitudinal or has repeated instruments, the function will remove blank records. 

#### Show the Field Labels Inside RStudio

* After loading data into R using RStudio with the `import_instruments()` function, you can see both the variable name and the text that appears to users of REDCap.  All you need to do is click on the dataset's name in the **Environment** tab or use the View() function. The column headings will include both the variable name and the Field Label from REDCap. 

* ðŸ’¥ NEW in Version 1.1 ðŸ’¥  Functions coming from packages outside of `tidyREDCap` may not understand what to do with labeled variables.  So, `tidyREDCap` includes a new `drop_labels()` function that will allow you to strip the labels before using functions that want unlabeled data.

#### Working with <i>Choose One</i> Questions

* `make_choose_one_table()`: print a `janitor::tabyl()` style table with a variable label.  This function lets you print one choice from a <i>choose all that apply</i> question. 

#### Working with <i>Choose All that Apply</i> Questions

REDCap exports the responses to a <i>choose all that apply</i> question into many similarly named questions.  tidyREDCap helps summarize the responses with two functions:

* `make_binary_word()`: converts all the responses into a single descriptive "word"
* `make_choose_all_table()`: converts all the responses into a single summary table

#### Working with Repeated Measures

Projects that have repeated assessments with different questionnaires/instruments export with holes in the CSV.  tidyREDCap will parse the export and create tables for any of the questionnaires/instruments:

* `make_instrument()`: makes a tibble for a questionnaire/instrument

## Where Can I Find tidyREDCap?

#### Offical Release
You can get the latest official release of tidyREDCap from CRAN.
```
install.packages("tidyREDCap")
```

#### Development Release
Run these two lines of code to install tidyREDCap from GitHub (this requires [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) for Windows or Xcode for Mac to be installed on your computer):

```
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RaymondBalise/tidyREDCap")
```

#### What is new on the development release?

* ðŸ’¥ NEW in Version 1.1.0.9000 ðŸ’¥ adds `make_yes_no()` function to convert
  "checked" or "yes"-like answers to "Yes" and other answers to "No or Unknown".
* ðŸ’¥ NEW in Version 1.1.0.9000 ðŸ’¥ adds `make_yes_no_unknown()` function to 
  convert "checked" or "yes"-like  answers to "Yes"", unchecked or "no"-like 
  answers to "No" and other answers to "Unknown".
